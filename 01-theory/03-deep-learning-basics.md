# Deep Learning Basics

Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **neural networks** with many layers to learn complex patterns.

## What is a Neural Network?

- Inspired by the human brain  
- Consists of **neurons (nodes)** arranged in **layers**: input → hidden → output  
- Each neuron applies **weights** and **activation functions** to its inputs

## How Deep Learning Works

1. **Input layer** → data enters the network  
2. **Hidden layers** → neurons process and transform data  
3. **Output layer** → produces predictions or results  
4. **Training** → the network adjusts weights to minimize errors using backpropagation

## Example Applications

- **Image recognition** → Identify cats vs dogs in pictures  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** → Text classification, translation  
- **Generative AI** → Generate text, images, or audio

## Key Takeaways

- Deep learning allows machines to learn **hierarchical representations** of data.  
- Most modern GenAI models (LLMs, diffusion models) are **deep learning models**.  
- Understanding these basics helps you follow how Generative AI works under the hood.
