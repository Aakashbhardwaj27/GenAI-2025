# Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are deep learning models trained to **understand and generate human-like text**.

---

## What Makes a Model "Large"?

- Number of **parameters** (weights in the network)  
- Size of **training data** (billions of words, code, documents)  
- Examples: GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA, Claude  

---

## How LLMs Work

1. Input text â†’ Tokenized into units (tokens)  
2. Model predicts **next token** based on context  
3. Repeats until full output is generated  

---

## Capabilities

- Text generation, summarization, question-answering  
- Translation, code completion, reasoning  

---

## Limitations

- Context window limits how much text it can "remember"  
- May hallucinate or generate incorrect information  
- Large models are resource-intensive  

---

## Key Takeaways

- LLMs are **the core of modern GenAI**.  
- Understanding tokens, context, and fine-tuning is crucial for effective use.
