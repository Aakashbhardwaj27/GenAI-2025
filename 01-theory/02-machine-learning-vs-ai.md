# Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence

AI is the **umbrella term**. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on **learning patterns from data** to make predictions or decisions.

## Key Differences

| Feature | AI | Machine Learning (ML) |
|---------|----|---------------------|
| Definition | Broad field to simulate human intelligence | Enables systems to learn from data |
| Approach | Rules, logic, knowledge representation | Statistical models and pattern recognition |
| Examples | Expert systems, reasoning engines | Linear regression, classification, clustering |

## How ML Works

1. **Collect data** → raw text, images, or numbers  
2. **Preprocess data** → clean, normalize, or encode  
3. **Train model** → teach it patterns from data  
4. **Evaluate** → test performance on unseen data  
5. **Deploy** → make predictions in real-world applications

## Common ML Algorithms

- **Regression** → Predict a numeric value (e.g., house prices)  
- **Classification** → Categorize items (e.g., spam detection)  
- **Clustering** → Group similar items (e.g., customer segmentation)

## Why ML Matters for AI

- Machine Learning is the **engine** behind modern AI systems.  
- Generative AI (like ChatGPT) uses **deep learning**, an advanced form of ML.
