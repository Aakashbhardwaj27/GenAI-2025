# Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of AI that **creates new content** instead of just analyzing or classifying it.  

It can generate **text, images, audio, or code** based on examples it has learned from.

## Generative AI vs Traditional AI

| Type | Function | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Traditional AI | Recognizes or classifies | Spam filters, image recognition |
| Generative AI | Produces new content | ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion |

## How Generative AI Works

- Learns patterns from large datasets  
- Uses models like **transformers** to predict next token/word/image piece  
- Generates content based on input prompts

## Real-World Applications

- **Text**: Chatbots, content generation, summaries  
- **Images**: AI art, product designs  
- **Audio**: Music, speech synthesis  
- **Code**: AI-assisted programming

## Key Takeaways

1. Generative AI **creates content**, not just analyzes it.  
2. Transformers and LLMs are the backbone of most GenAI systems.  
3. Understanding GenAI is essential before diving into LLMs and RAG.
