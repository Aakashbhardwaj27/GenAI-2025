# 🛣 Generative AI Roadmap (2025–2026)

This roadmap is designed for **developers, IT professionals, and software engineers** who want to learn Generative AI (GenAI) in a structured, practical way.  
The goal is to move from fundamentals → tools → engineering → projects → real-world applications.

---

## **Phase 1: Fundamentals (Understand the AI landscape)**

### 1. AI vs ML vs GenAI
- Understand the difference between AI, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.  
- Key concepts: LLMs, embeddings, fine-tuning, RAG.  
- Resources:  
  - [DeepLearning.ai AI For Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)  
  - [Intro to Generative AI — YouTube]  

### 2. Core LLM Concepts
- Tokens, context window, temperature, top-k/top-p sampling.  
- Prompt engineering basics.  
- Evaluation metrics (perplexity, F1, BLEU, human evaluation).

### 3. Key Terms Cheat Sheet
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- Agents, MCP, tools, chains  
- Embeddings, vector DBs  
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)  

### 4. Math & Stats Foundations (optional but recommended)
- Linear algebra, probability, matrices, dot product, cosine similarity  
- Why embeddings work and similarity search  

---

## **Phase 2: Tools & Libraries (Hands-on experimentation)**

### 1. Python AI Stack
- Python 3.x, virtual environments, pip  
- Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Transformers  

### 2. LangChain vs AutoGen
- Understanding agent orchestration and multi-tool pipelines  
- Example: Build a mini agent that answers questions from a local document  

### 3. HuggingFace
- Using pre-trained models for text, images, audio  
- Fine-tuning basics  

### 4. OpenAI & Azure OpenAI
- GPT-4, GPT-4o, embeddings, APIs  
- Real-time audio, streaming responses  
- Rate limits and cost optimization  

### 5. Vector Databases
- Introduction to pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate  
- Embedding storage, similarity search, semantic retrieval  

---

## **Phase 3: Engineering Patterns**

### 1. RAG Pattern (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Why it matters  
- Simple implementation: query → embedding search → prompt → LLM  
- Mini-project: Build a document Q&A system  

### 2. Agents & MCP
- Simple agents vs multi-agent orchestration (MCP)  
- How to decide which approach fits your use case  

### 3. Evaluation & Metrics
- Automatic evaluation: F1, BLEU, ROUGE  
- Human evaluation  
- Feedback loops & retraining strategies  

### 4. Deployment Patterns
- Serving LLMs in APIs  
- Cost optimization strategies  
- Monitoring, logging, error handling  

---

## **Phase 4: Projects (Build while learning)**

### Project 1: Chatbot from scratch
- Use LangChain + OpenAI embeddings  
- Context-aware answers from documents  

### Project 2: AI Interviewer App
- Capture text/audio input  
- Generate real-time feedback  
- Stream responses to frontend  

### Project 3: Document Search + Summarization
- Store PDFs in vector DB  
- Semantic search + summarization + RAG pipeline  

### Project 4: Generative Product Ideas
- Feed company/product info  
- Generate AI-powered suggestions  
- Integrate evaluation metrics  

---

## **Phase 5: Real-world Use Cases**

- Enterprise workflows: automate reporting, customer support, code review  
- Finance: AI-driven insights, fraud detection, analysis automation  
- Healthcare: summarization of patient notes, clinical recommendations  
- Product & Productivity: AI copilots, content generation, ideation  

---

## **Phase 6: Resources**

- Papers: “Attention is All You Need”, “RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation”  
- Videos: DeepLearning.AI GenAI series, LangChain tutorials  
- Podcasts & Blogs: Lex Fridman, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI blog  
- Cheatsheets: prompt engineering, embeddings, vector DB queries

## ✅ How to Use This Roadmap

1. Start at **Phase 1** → learn fundamentals.  
2. Move to **Phase 2** → install tools and experiment.  
3. Follow **Phase 3** → understand real-world engineering patterns.  
4. Build at least **2–3 projects from Phase 4**.  
5. Explore **Phase 5** for industry applications and inspiration.  
6. Keep reference from **Phase 6** to stay updated.  

> Remember: Learning GenAI is iterative. Build → experiment → fail → improve → repeat. Focus on *practical application*, not just theory.
