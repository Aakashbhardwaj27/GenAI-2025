## ✅ How to Use This Matrix
1. **Identify your current skill level** for each area.  
2. **Pick one skill/project at a time** to focus on.  
3. **Build mini-projects** to solidify learning.  
4. **Track your progress** and move to the next skill/project.  
5. Combine multiple skills in **Phase 4 projects** from the roadmap.  

> Tip: Focus on practical application — theory without code won’t get you far in GenAI.
